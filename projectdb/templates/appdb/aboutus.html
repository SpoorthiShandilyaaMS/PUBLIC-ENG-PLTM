                The way that politics plays out online is fascinating. Endless polls, endless opinions, rant
                statuses and little that actually changes in the real world. Political accountability refers to the
                responsibility or obligation of government officials to act in the best interests of society or face
                consequences. Public officials should be held responsible for their actions. And
                Accountability is important in evaluating the on-going effectiveness of public officials or
                bodies ensures that they are performing to their full potential, providing value for money,
                instilling confidence in the government and being responsive to the community. Public
                Engagement Platform is a citizen engagement platform and is our endeavor to promote the
                active participation of Indian citizens in their country's governance and development. It is also
                aimed at creating a common platform for citizens (say for a specific constituency) to crowd
                source governance ideas from citizens also. Using this application user shall be allowed to
                discuss and to contribute on various government projects and plans. If the people encounter
                some public issues it also allows users to upload the same and give a brief description about it
                and thus creating awareness and which will reach the representatives easily.<br><br><br>

            India is the largest democratic country in the world. Democracy is defined as the
                government of the people, by the people and for the people. And we all know that, isnâ€™t it?
                So, it is not possible for all the citizens to participate in the government and that is why we
                select our representatives at regular intervals. But today if we look at it is it really happening?
                Are we able to communicate with the government? Are all our problems reaching the
                representatives we select? If no what are real problems we are facing? Not all our problems
                are reaching the government. Even if they do, the results are null or not satisfactory. And
                most of the times they are ignored. And the process to file a complaint is quite old and is time
                consuming.<br>
                So, we have solution for all these problems. Our web application helps to overcome
                these problems.<br>
                The main objective of our application is to connect the citizens to Parliamentarians.
                The main idea is to build a web application which will provide a common platform for the
                people belonging to a constituency to create awareness about the different public issues.
                Public issues can be acknowledged to the representative. Promotes active participation of
                citizens in governance.<br><br><br>

            Let us consider a constituency. If there is a public issue there is no common platform which is
                effective in
                acknowledging it to the representative. And we cannot expect the representatives all the times to make
                time
                to listen to each of the problems. Once the problem is addressed, its progression should be intimidated
                to
                the public which in many cases could not happen. The process to file a complaint is too sluggish. There
                are
                many other citizen engagement platforms. And other similar application is MyGov, a Government funded app
                is
                other endeavor. But these websites somewhere fails to address the minute issues of minute constituencies
                and
                also fails to involve the local representatives.<br>
